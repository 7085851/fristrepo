# hear i am telling  about the function programming in python
# 1 print ("print function which call the out put")
# now hear how to to you define the own function like print is aslo define some one 




#  frist 1 way defing the function 
 
#  def write_name_functin():
#     enter the values of function accurding to you need 

#     print namr_of _function same to same with function name we write with def fuction ()



# second 2 why to define the function 


# def name of function ():
#     text="enter  the vaules we need to in output  "
#     print(text)
# print name of the function 





# # 3rd why 
# #  def name of function(text)
# # print(text)
# # printname of the function("enter the vaules which need in output")



# example 
def learning_python():
    print("we are learning python with m ibrahim ")
    print("wa are learning python with m ibrahim")
    print("we are learning python with m ibrahim")
learning_python()

# example with 2 why
def learning_python():
    text = "we are learning python with muhammad ibrahim "
    print(text)
    print(text)
    print(text)
learning_python()    

# # # 3rd why example

def learning_python(text):
    print(text)
    print(text)
    print(text)
learning_python("weare learning python with muhammad ibrahim")    




# real world  example with clearity 





def school_colculator(age , text):
    if age==5 :
       print(" ibrahim join the school ")
    elif age > 5 :
       print(" we are  join the higer classes")      
    else :
       print(" we are  still baby baby baby baby baby  ") 

# school_colculator(5,"text")

# this short example of meachine learning model which predicted the age 
def future_age(age):
   new_age=age+20
   return new_age
   print(new_age)
future_predicted_age=  future_age(5)
